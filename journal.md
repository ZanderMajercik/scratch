Development Journal for porting Raybox demo to unreal engine 4

7/1: Downloaded and installed UE4 on the windows partition of my machine. At first creation of new projects didn't work becuase didnt have windows sdk 8.1. Simple download solved the problem.
UE4 provides a high level GUI to place and move objects in the scene. When an object is created, VS is spawned to edit the C++ code.
